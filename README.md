# stm32-zephyr-dev

To provide a more consistent development environment, I created a containerized STM32 and 
Zephyr RTOS setup that I could use to flash my STM32L476RG board. Itâ€™s designed to work 
across platformsâ€”including Linux, macOS, and Apple Siliconâ€”by running in either standard 
Docker or Apple Containers. This project uses a Fedora-based image (with Ubuntu support 
in progress) and includes everything needed to build and flash STM32 firmware in a 
reproducible way.

## ðŸ”¦ Example: Flashing Blinky to STM32

Flashing a basic Blinky firmware from inside the container to an STM32L476RG board.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- (Optional) [Apple Containers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applecontainers)
- STM32L476RG board (or compatible STM32 MCU)
- USB-A to USB cable
- `make`

### Build the Fedora-based Container

```bash
make build_fedora
```

### Run the Container (with USB access for flashing)
> make run_fedora will automatically run make build_fedora if the image doesn't exist yet.

```bash
make run_fedora
```

These scripts handle building and running the container with proper USB passthrough so you can flash directly from inside the environment using OpenOCD.
